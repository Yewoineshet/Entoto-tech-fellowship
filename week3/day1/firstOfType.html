<div>  <h3>TRAVER NOAH</h3>
 This particular Sunday, the Sunday I was hurled from a moving car, started out like any other Sunday.
My mother woke me up, made me porridge for breakfast. I took my bath while she dressed my baby
brother Andrew, who was nine months old. Then we went out to the driveway, but once we were finally
all strapped in and ready to go, the car wouldn’t start. My mom had this ancient, broken-down, brighttangerine Volkswagen Beetle
 that she picked up for next to nothing.

<div> 
The reason she got it for next to
nothing was because it was always breaking down. To this day I hate secondhand cars. Almost everything
that’s ever gone wrong in my life I can trace back to a secondhand car. Secondhand cars made me get
detention for being late for school. Secondhand cars left us hitchhiking on the side of the freeway.

A secondhand car was also the reason my mom got married. If it hadn’t been for the Volkswagen that didn’t
work, we never would have looked for the mechanic who became the husband who became the stepfather
who became the man who tortured us for years and put a bullet in the back of my mother’s head—I’ll take
the new car with the warranty every time.
